#  Adventure-Works2019
##  A study on Adventure Works 2019 relational database from Microsoft.
In this project, SQL is used for Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation, Python(pandas,matplotlib) for data Visualization,SQL SSMS for Data transformation.
With the use of specific data found in Adventure works we were tasked to answer the following questions:

**1.What is the regional sales in the best performing country?**

Get the table Sales.SalesTerritory which relates country and revenue.

Get the columns needed CountryRegionCode,SalesLastYear,SalesYTD

Calculate total sales by country using functions SUM(),GROUP BY and alias total sales using AS in SQL.

Save the query using VIEW in SQL.

To visualise the data,connect SQL server in Visual Studio Code.Create dataframe from the saved query.

Import the libraries matplotlib,pandas,numpy.Create a dataframe for SQL query.Add new column CountryName to the dataframe.

Plot by horizontal bar graph which compares the sales data for last year and current year.

For further understanding plot pie chart forSales last Yar and SalesYTD using corresponding codes in visual studio code.
